Dockerized headless version of https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop[Draw.io Desktop]

== What is does

Draw.io Desktop expose a command-line client to allow us to create, check or export diagrams.

Since Draw.io Desktop is an GUI application, we need an GUI environment to run it.
And this prevent us to use it for automation in non-GUI environment such as CI tools.

This docker image enable us to run the command-line client in a headless mode by using a configurable **X** server.

Other minor addition are available

* Add timeout capability since the application can hang sometimes (due to user action needed in GUI mode)
* Clear the output log from Electron Security Warning
* Disable auto-update functionality to avoid unneccessary log
